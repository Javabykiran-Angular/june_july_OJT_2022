	- Angular is component Orientated arch.
	- Component
		1 View file => .html
		2 Stylesheet => .css
		3 Component file => .ts
		4 testing => .specs.ts
		- every component has only 1 view file & only 1 ts file
		- but stylesheet file one or more is available 
		- metadata
			- it gives extra information about component
			@Component({
				....
			})
